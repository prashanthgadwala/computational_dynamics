This demo code provides a simple example of a cantilever beam subjected to traction forces applied at its free end to initiate oscillations. The setup is designed to illustrate the dynamic response of the beam and can serve as a reference or starting point for more advanced elastodynamics simulations. 

The student can check the tutorial for FEniCS legacy (older release) in [https://comet-fenics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demo/elastodynamics/demo_elastodynamics.py.html](https://comet-fenics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demo/elastodynamics/demo_elastodynamics.py.html), on which the present demo code is inspired.
